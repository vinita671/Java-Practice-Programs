Operators:
==========
-Operators are used to perform operations on Operators.
-ex:
    10+20 =30

    Types:
    -------
    1.Arithmetic Operators
    2.Relational Operators
    3.Logical Operators
    4.Bitwise Operators
    5.Assignment Operators
    6.Conditional Operators
    7.Increment and Decrement Operators

    1.Arithmetic operations:
    ---------------------------
    -Arithmetic Operators are used to perform mathematical operations on operands.
    - binary operands (bcoz tow operators are required).

    types:
          + addition
          - subtraction
          * multiplication
          / division-quotient
          % modulus-remainder

  Note:- + is used for concatenation of strings       

  2. Relational Operators:(Comparison operands)
  -----------------------------------------------
   - Relational operands  are used to compare tow operands.
   - binary operands(bcoz tow operands are required).
   - returns true or false.(boolean value)

types:
== equle
!= not equal to
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal to
<= leaa than or equal to 

5.Assignment Operators:(Compound Assignment Operators)
--------------------------------------------------------

  - Assignment Operators used to perform operands
    and assing to a reference
    
  - binary operands


  += addition
  -= subtraction
  *= multiplication
  /= division(quotient)
  %= division (remainder)
